 A task takes 4 Â½ hours to complete. Two workers, A and B start working on it and take turns
alternately. A works for 25 minutes at a time and is paid Rs 50, B works for 75 minutes at a time
and is paid Rs. 150. Display the total number of turns taken by A and B, calculate their total
amounts and also the total cost of the task.
