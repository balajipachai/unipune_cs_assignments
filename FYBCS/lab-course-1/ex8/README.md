# To demonstrate Recursion

## You should read the following topics before starting this exercise

1. Recursive definition
2. Declaring and defining a function
3. How to call a function
4. How to pass parameters to a function

```
Recursion is a process by which a function calls itself either directly or indirectly. The points to be
remembered while writing recursive functions
 - Each time the function is called recursively it must be closer to the solution.
 - There must be some terminating condition, which will stop recursion.
 - Usually the function contains an if â€“else branching statement where one branch makes
recursive call while other branch has non-recursive terminating condition
```

### Note

`Expressions having recursive definitions can be easily converted into recursive functions`
