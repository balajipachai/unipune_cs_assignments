# unipune_cs_assignments
A repository that contains all the Computer Science Programs (FYBCS, SYBCS and TYBCS). 
It is a work in progress, thus you might not find all the programs.
However, expect all the programs to be at one place soon.

# Steps for Executing a Program
1. Go to the main directory (for eg: simple_loops)
2. Set A, Set B and Set C programs are in a,b and c directory respectively.
3. An executable file has been created for each program.
4. Execute the program by ./nameOfTheExecutable
