# unipune_cs_assignments
A repository that contains all the Computer Science Programs (FYBCS, SYBCS and TYBCS). 
It is a work in progress, thus you might not find all the programs.
However, expect all the programs to be at one place soon.

# Steps for Executing a Program
1. Go to the main directory (for eg: simple_loops)
2. Set A, Set B and Set C programs are named as follows:
  - Set A Problem 1 => seta_1.c and similary for Set B and Set C
4. Compile the program
  - gcc seta_1.c
  - ./a.out
  - Provide user inputs
  - Done
